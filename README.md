# hello-world

Hey all,

Walton here, I am 20 years old and about currently embarking on a journey into the Javascript world. Currently, I'm reading eloquent Javascript and finding it easy to read and understand which is nice when you are starting off. I'm also on codecademy learning Javascript and I must say coding is pretty fun. If there are any other great resources please list them below.
